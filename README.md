# Catch-the-Turtle
Practice Project - Code learned from and adapted from Youtube "Pong" Tutorial by Christian Thompson. Please see comment in file (see below):

"Catch the Turtle" is the first project I have made
in Python(level: novice). This was adapted
from a Youtube tutorial by Christian Thompson
teaching how to make Pong using turtle
module in Python. I found the tutorial
through "Learn Python by Building
Five Games - Full Course by freeCodeCamp.org.
    Youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc
        Pong: 0:01:18 - 0:45:36

I also heavily relied on docs.python.org,
geeksforgeeks.org, & stackoverflow.com.
